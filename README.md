This repo contains some programs I've writted for the `SPIM`
envoironment. I've written them for learning more about
low-level programming.

You can find `spim` in Debian's official repository.

For running, for instance, `hello.asm` type from bash-console

    $ spim -file hello.asm

otherwise you can use the `goSPIM` script I've written. Obviously, you
need to make the script executable first, hence

    $ chmod +x goSPIM
    
As a guide -- both for learning and taking exercises -- I've
used [this](http://ellard.org/dan/www/Courses/cs50-asm.pdf) book by
_Daniel Ellard_ (1994).
